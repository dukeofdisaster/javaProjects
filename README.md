# Trains
Practice java project; booking system for European trains

Time class-- Needs debugging; Initially overcomplicated the time conversions with tons of variables. The driver
still outputs accurate data, however the time can be simplified. 
  Ex: int totalMinutes = 170; 
      int hours = minutes/60; // returns 2 due to integer division
      int minutes = totalMinutes % 60;returns 50, the remainder.
 The current code still has heavy complications within the addMinutes() method from the Time class.
